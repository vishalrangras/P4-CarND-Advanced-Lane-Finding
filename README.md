# P4-CarND-Advanced-Lane-Finding
This project detects the road lane, its curvature and position of vehicle from the center of the road


For a lane line that is close to vertical, you can fit a line using this formula: f(y) = Ay^2 + By + C, where A, B, and C are coefficients.

A gives you the curvature of the lane line, B gives you the heading or direction that the line is pointing, and C gives you the position of the line based on how far away it is from the very left of an image (y = 0).

# camera matrix and distortion coefficients
